            The player is meant to help you record a song by hand or practice an existing song with the two
            practice tools. <br/>
            You can also import sheets made in the app / record audio of the keyboard and play freely, you also have a
            metronome to help you
            with the tempo. <br/>
            If you want a simpler keyboard you can use the <AppLink href={'/zen-keyboard'}>Zen keyboard</AppLink> which
            has
            all the instruments and pitch settings, but bigger keyboard and simpler interface.<br/>
            In the settings you can change the instrument, pitch, reverb, volume, keyboard size, etc...

            If you have a MIDI keyboard, you can connect it to your device, follow the <AppLink
            href={'/blog/connect-midi-device'}>MIDI device </AppLink>

                end</BlogLi>
            <BlogLi>This selects the playback speed of the song, useful when you are trying to play along with the

            <BlogLi>When in practice mode, this is a note that you should press now. When this note appears, it will
                fade
                in red, when the fade in finishes, it will indicate the moment when you should press the note to stay in
                tempo</BlogLi>
            <BlogLi>This indicator tells you that this note will be pressed after you finished pressing all the current
                red
                notes.</BlogLi>
            <BlogLi>This opens the song library, it's a small library made years ago by the sky music community</BlogLi>

            When you open the "song menu", you will be shown this window. Your songs will be split between recorded and
            composed
            songs. The recorded songs are the ones which were recorded by hand, the composed songs are the ones which
            were
            composed using
            the <AppLink href={'/composer'}>composer</AppLink>.
            Here you can select the song to play/practice. Or download, change, rename and move between your folders.

                song.

                have to
                press in that moment. This should be used to learn a song, you can select sections to replay by using
                the
                notes selection bar on the right.

                Pressing this button will start the second kind of practice, the approaching circles, circles will
                appear coming
                towards the note, once they reach it, you should press the note. This is meant to be used once you are
                more
                comfortable with the song, it is harder to play compared to the practice mode, but will test your muscle
                memory.
            </BlogLi>
            <BlogLi>
                Opens the menu for that song, showing options to rename, move to a folder, edit, download and delete the
                song.

                Those two are the download buttons, the first one is the suggested one to share it with other people, or
                to backup your
                songs. The second one downloads the song as a MIDI song, this will convert it to MIDI, but it will cause
                some information
                to be lost, as MIDI cannot store some information that is needed by the app, use it only if you need to
                import it in another
                app which is not this one.
