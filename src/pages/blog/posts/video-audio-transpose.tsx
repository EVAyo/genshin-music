            In the V3.3 release, a new experimental feature has been added that allows you to convert any video/audio
            into a
            sheet, by first
            converting it to MIDI, by using <AppLink href={'https://basicpitch.spotify.com/'}> Spotify&apos;s Basic
            Pitch </AppLink>.

        <BlogP>

            This feature is to be used only as a last resort after you cannot find a MIDI song to transpose, or you
            can't do
            it by hand.
            It is not meant to create a perfect transposition, as the conversion is very difficult, but mostly as a
            starting
            point to
            help you transpose a song manually.

            It is best if you can find a video/audio of a song that uses a single instrument, the piano is the easiest
            to
            convert. Even
            better if there is no background noise.

        </Header>
        <BlogP>
            The transposition steps are very similar to the ones of MIDI transposition, if you want to see how to do
            that,
            visit the <AppLink href={'/blog/posts/midi-transpose'}> MIDI transposition guide </AppLink>. You have to
            open
            the MIDI conversion tool, and select the audio/video file by clicking the file selection button "Open
            MIDI/Audio/Video file"
